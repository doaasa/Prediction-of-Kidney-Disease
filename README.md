# Chronic Kidney Disease 

## Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine.
## Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.

## In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, one might have few signs or symptoms. One might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.
